Here the output files for a given example are saved. In some cases, they should be deleted manually to ensure that a task is run. It is generally possible to indicate a different folder for the output through the settings files. The output files are grouped in several folders:
- `figures` contains figures generated during the workflow.
- `logs` contains logs of the processes. **Currently not in use.**
- `paraview` contains output files to be open with Paraview, i.e. XDMF files from the simulations.
- `results` contains results from the different tasks. The formats may vary.
